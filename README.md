# Image-Classification

In this project im trying different algorithm/ models in order to learn to classify the cifar-10 dataset images correctly. The architectures that i implemented are:    

• Multi Layer Perceptron 

• Convolutional Neural Netowork 

• Autoencoder neural network along with a classifier neural network

• SVM with linear & RBF kernel and MLP with hinge loss

• K-Nearest-Neighbors and Nearest-Class-Centroid algorithms.
