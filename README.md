# Image-Classification

The project contains 2 different ipynb files, 
The conv file , which is trying to solve the cifar10 dataset image classification problem using convolutional neural network architecture
And the dense file, which is trying to solve the problem using a MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) architecture with dense connected layers.
